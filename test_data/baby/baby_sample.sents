132	wife sucessful using pump generally speaking pump numerous idiosyncrasies consider purchasing
132	done homework likely would chosen different pump
132	could return personal item babies us youve opened would
132	main complaint pump practical
132	wife expresses fair amount milk using product obtained amount milk using medela pump symphony
132	long unrelated story rented medela pump weeks provided useful period compare products sidebyside
132	order importance setup lot parts plug connect ultimately clean mention misplace loose
132	medela pump beat handsdown front
132	managing process home chore youre pumping work would imagine becomes even difficult
132	suppose avent dont provide option car power adapter
132	avent tries sugar fact gate instructional dvd provide
132	`` setup appears difficult first youll soon become use ``
132	yeah get used
132	dont competing products think deal middle night sleep deprived
132	tubing previous user stated tubing flexible
132	especially compared medelas tubing
132	tubing avent duos pumps corresponding control cord bound together base 75 length tubes
132	medelas separate tubes pump
132	much flexible lighter
132	medelas product easier attach separate much less prone tip
132	bad design avents part
132	fortunately time wife still home dont remove tubing pump see becoming issue returns work
132	top heavy mentioned reviews pump units top heavy prone tipping
132	first time happened wife cried
132	tubing exacerbates problem
132	buy pump warned careful
132	mentioned reviews make base stabilizers 4oz bottles
132	knowledge youre luck larger bottles via bottles
132	keep mind using bigger avent bottles doesnt solve topheavy problem
132	waste compared medela pump milk wasted using avent pump
132	trust every drop counts youll see
132	frustrating see precious drops going waste
132	milk tends collect behind soft petals front horns
132	difficult messy harvest drops
132	also milk pools rubber diaphram creates suction horn
132	area right milk drop bottle
132	think would design milk flows right
132	well doesnt raise level separate component need plug bottom horn
132	milk collects easier harvest however pulling cap diaphram pouring bottle
132	poor design
132	lastly horns dont seem designed angle drop medela ones need hunch compensate
132	milk collects behind soft petals
132	overall medela pump easier use comfortable wastes less milk
132	recapturing little waste madela pump certainly easier
132	noise medela symphony product barely audible
132	pump makes fair amount noise
132	another review noted expecting quiter
132	perhaps cheaper medela pumps arent quite one using
132	collectively detract overall usefulness practicality
132	considering paid pump im disappointed experience expecting much better product
132	im willing bet youll disappointed
132	pumping task youll need perform many times day extended length time
132	best case scenario pumping task endure
132	make difficult needs one last bit anecdotal information cant seem escape sf bay area awesome maternity support center named dayone
132	among many services provide breast pumps
132	new pump comes market ask vendors provide pumps testing purposes
132	avent refused request
132	resource center one influential providers information breastfeeding mothers area
132	pump good allow center test pump months
132	instead avent distributes pump bru
132	due respect staff stores little insight offer consumers extensive experience pumps sell
132	call conspiracy theorist leads believe avents got something hide
132	new product avent solve problems highly recommend consider alternative
132	hope review come across jaded
132	strong pump
132	however one strength certainly eclipsed many weaknesses listed
132	nothing else throw commentary take factors mention setup waste tubing overall practicality consideration selecting pump
132	especially relates pumping
132	remember youll need pumping middle night
132	best luck choose carefully
133	love bottle warmer
133	one different brand kitchen
133	wanted get one babys room didnt come downstairs warm bottle middle night got one
133	much better brand
133	warms bottles within 23 minutes
133	one takes least minutes usually longer
133	daughter wakes feeding go room put bottle warmer turn incidentally use tall oz dr brown bottles find fit cooler fine problems
133	bottle warming change diaper
133	bottle usually done warming time get new diaper
133	yes generally cries majority process shes waiting bottle babies cry theyre hungry
133	23 minutes certainly lifetime

834	gate usable hes least 35 40 pounds
834	addition since made metal bars sort crisscross pattern child stick toes try climb overall step bottom metal bar inches ground
834	added bonus gate tall enough keep kids tall cat cant jump easily
834	caveats think tighten tension screws periodically
834	gate opening inches narrower would ideal youre `` wide '' like get used kind sidestepping
834	default gate makes audible `` click '' closes wake lightsleeping child little practice get close soundlessly
834	wrench provided tightening plastic tension screws get tight wrench tends slip little easily

904	jo high chair cover fits newer graco highchairs including holes safety straps wipe clean sponge stays cleaner
904	unlike cloth cover doesnt pick show every bit food touches
904	sticky hands grabbing everything sight thats big plus
904	high chair looks neater cleaner definitely sanitary
904	havent experienced slipping others written
904	started using cover son months old sitting
904	perhaps slipping due design wooden highchairs rather pad
904	newer graco chairs adjustable recline prevent baby slipping forward

1316	despite rather passionately dismissive words least one reviewerwho apparently finds ridiculous someone might need trash bag big enough know entire familyi going come `` big enough '' side argument
1316	im going venture guess reviewers think bag plenty room either single people childless couples
1316	youre typically person car usually grab starbucks way work want place toss candy bar wrappers gas receipts trash occasional solo trip mcdonalds provided arent big eater bag large enough probably need empty every day two
1316	however like family six even four bag isnt big enough even one trip subway
1316	inches really ridiculously tiny consider much trash bunch kids road trip produce
1316	xl designation opinion somewhat misleading
1316	xl cant imagine tiny even size bags must
1316	guess maybe could get coffee cup much else
1316	durability quality seems well made
1316	doesnt tip material seems pretty good quality really like fact lid hide unsightly garbage
1316	primarily gave three stars think manufacturer shouldnt claiming `` xl '' sizei know really looked specs ordering mind xl means xl feel like little mislead
1316	generally person car bag good choice
1316	families though keep looking
1316	since bag wasnt terribly expensive probably hang onto use front seat days dont kids ill looking something larger back seat
1317	may consider product `` necessity '' definitely makes child little bit happier shopping means get extra time store
1317	durable easy wash
1317	really didnt consider someone gave us gifthad known much happier pumpkin would storei would bought one months ago

1776	looking quick convenient way keep child warm
1777	wondering evenflo embrace car seat base works aura model well
1777	whatever reason evenflo doesnt make obvious aura seat works embrace base
1777	took car seat base safety council area
1777	installed base minutes practice able install base 10 minutes
1777	disagree negative reviews car seat base rated safe easy installi drive chevy cavalier
1777	presumably installing car seats bases cavalier nightmare
1777	install base still moves around suggest contact professional show install correctly safely
1778	although didnt like price tag made investment stroller twins outgrown infant car seats therefore infant stroller
1778	justification price would last stroller
1778	even remotely true
1778	initially worked well
1778	never used drink trays said many reviews worthless
1778	kids got heavier though weigh 20 lbs im talking heavy stroller became difficult turn
1778	side side strollers issues tight spaces however able turn easily resulted leaving many stores couldnt either get tight doors get around shop
1778	stroller absolutely worth money regret spent money
1778	babiesrus wont take back anymore stuck 300 paper weight
1779	like potty compact comfortable easy clean
1779	really small bought full size babybjorn potty use house

1780	although one reviews knocks picture rabbit son really enjoyed would stare constantly
1780	reason really enjoyed little white tabs manufacture name
1781	son absolutely loves jumping jumpster
1781	even fall asleep
1781	find safe though youll need make sure baby holds onto handles
1781	wish straps could adjusted
1781	tall baby he/she may grow fast
1782	like wipe okay best nonclorine wipe
1782	buy refill packs seem dry unlike tubs purchased past
1782	wipes smaller overall moist earths best
1783	storage system perfect already using playtex dropin system pros:1 need purchase separate storage bags freezer
1783	since pumping storing directly dropin liners youd using dropin bottles need purchase separate bottles storage bags
1783	kit comes adapter work certain popular pumps like medela
1783	make sure purchase newer kits though
1783	sisterinlaw unknowingly purchased older kit came one pump adapter instead two
1783	perfect amount feeding
1783	since using exact dropin liner would regular feeding freeze exact amount want
1783	anywhere oz 10 oz
1783	need thaw entire bag unused wasted milk worry using milk bag within certain amount time
1783	far ive seen breastmilk freezer storage bags store oz
1783	baby drinking oz bag holds oz thaw bags
1783	one step storage thaw need
1783	convenient less loss milk nutrients
1783	since pump directly dropin liner need purchase separate storage bags
1783	saves time steps
1783	one step storage pump dropin liner freeze ready use screw onto nurser thaw serve
1783	storage systems pump bottle pour storage bag thaw storage bag pour back bottle
1783	think much milk nutrients losing extra transfers
1783	also people told incidents storage bags leaked accidentally spill milk transfer bottle
1783	perfect long trips pop frozen liner onto nurser stays colder longer cooler long trips
1783	cons:1 kits come set
1783	purchase entire kit cant purchase additional rings lids
1783	ended purchasing total kits
1783	found cheaper additional kits ebay
1783	dont mind im using freezer use fridge `` fresh '' milk
1783	run storage rings use advice another reviewer take liners throw large freezer bag
1783	plan long term type storage make sure freeze right side instead upside instructed though
1783	takes room freezer
1783	since dont freeze store flat like storage bags take space freezer convenience worth
1783	take rings throw freezer bags able store
1783	doesnt work well expandable 810 oz liners instructed
1783	works perfectly oz preformed liners expandable 810 oz liners
1783	expands would make difficult insert nurser frozen instructed
1783	would probably work fine original preformed oz liners
1783	find online generic versions
1783	havent used either instead worked expandable liners
1783	id freeze right side nursers instead upside instructed frozen pop bottom nurser throw freezer bag
1783	comes time use would reinsert bottom nurser thaw
1783	get frozen liner back nurser string storage ring top storage lid thaw
1783	screw storage ring onto nurser mess free thaw transfer
1783	liners difficult read
1783	difficult see measurements clear liners ive learned gauge pretty well amounts breastfeed never know exact amount anyways
1783	youre really anal pump bottles provided pump measure pouring liners
1783	overall review since already using playtex dropin system storage system really convenient
1783	husband little patience would liked thaw separate bag pour bottle serve
1783	bind ive taken frozen liner straight freezer thawed hot water 10 minutes
1784	really like cd player right crib easily accessible
1784	dont worry another big cd player daughters room taking space fits perfectly
1784	highly recommend product grumpy sleeper needs soothing music
1785	great smelling cologne men outstanding price
1785	brother purchased smaller bottle departments store twice price earlier day
1785	wow kicking realized threw away receipt
1786	easy install easy use fun little one
1786	installed patio loves swinging outside
1786	babysitter swears upset needs way make smile instantly takes outside puts swing
1787	pillow made sleeping bed much easier especially got closer due date
1787	didnt want massive pillow one fits great im 54
1788	thing works
1788	quick simple effective
1788	little guesswork involved figuring amount water needed heat varying amounts liquid bottle youve got figured youre good go
1788	compact design makes easy travel must
1789	pense que era una muy buena compra ya que la marca es bien reconocida
1789	el primer defecto que le note fue que era muy ruidoso pero trate de ignorarlo confiando que iba resultarme bueno por su marca
1789	las dos semanas de usarlo la copa para el seno se le abrieron grietas en el plastico haciendo dificil poder succionar bien
1789	luego que logre conseguir el repuesto de la pieza sucedio que tres semanas despues se por cual razon dejo de succionar con fuerza dura pena lograba sacarme en 15 minutos 1/2 onzas cuando normalmente sacaba onzas en 10 minutos
1789	siento que para el valor del producto 79
1789	99 fue una terrible compra ya que termine comprandome uno nuevo de distinta marca
1789	espero tener mejor suerte pues mi bebe apenas tiene semanas falta mucho tiempo por delante de usar este aparato

2745	last week came car find mirror part strap lying backseat tether attachment still set
2745	strap seems disintegrated middle

2747	mat easy clean spitup
2747	think itchy like reviews
2747	however daughter smaller put recieving blanket
2747	also wide cousin lay
2747	definetly worth money use everday
2748	ok skeptical especially others written pediatrician said bottles dont make difference know baby best say birth second baby began supplementing formula using avant bottles used first colicy noticed baby writhing pain getting burps waking middle restful periods screaming gas pain
2748	naturally thought going deal fact another baby colic remembered friend recommended dr
2748	waited 24 hours see really worked writing review sure enough much happier sleeping soundly pulled little legs pain gas
2748	avent bottles even hard time getting burp dr
2748	browns seems easier time burping
2748	re leaks havent problem
2748	re washing get
2748	better baby take extra 10 seconds
2748	frankly little concerned extra parts washing really big deal
2748	finally one bit advice another mommy friend gave dont heat bottles mean dont heat whatever youre putting bottle
2748	make life much easier get baby used eating something room temp use room temp bottled water make formula feed straight away way reduces step makes extra washing youre pinch somewhere dont stress heat bottles
2748	week old fact take bottle straight fridge still nursing goes back forth warm breast cold/room temp bottle problem
2748	understand babies different babies particular he/she take opt heat especially given warnings late wierd chemicals leaking plastics food stuff upon heating
2748	would also recommend buying 4oz go 8oz outgrow 4oz quickly say bottles expensive really arent much
2748	espeically given sanity regain worth every cent
2748	im sorry didnt luck product worth shot feeling desperate youre new parent wondering product start
2748	wish someone encouraged try first might saved lot tears part babys
2749	hated product stop using pad number false alarms
2749	daughter active sleeper would scoot crib night
2749	even putting board matress alarm would go every time directly pad
2749	wed go running room every time alarm went find sleeping peacefully
2749	still use monitor would better buying something less expensive

2753	called customer service theyre sending replacement parts hassle
2753	con hard line carseat base markings stroller put wrong takes bit struggle release carseat base later
2753	also storage cargo area easily accessible enough clearance actually stick diaper bag easily unless car seat taken
2753	hang diaper bag handle bar works fine
2753	cup holders better used keys burpclothes drink easily jumbled surely spill without lid
2753	also hands would sometimes smell like rubber rubber grips handlebar

2993	simple attach disassemble reattach chairs take us whenever go hook restaurants friends houses

2994	head flat used left side
2994	skeptical first purchased im glad got
2995	son months old using seventh generation diapers wipes since born recommend
2995	aware however diapers run small doubt definitely buy next size
2996	son months old
2996	bought seat seat son using causing meltdowns car would scream soon knew going put got going taken still shrieking crying
2996	seat good reviews looked good bought hoping wouldnt cause meltdowns
2996	amazingly son ridden already fallen asleep car
2996	cant believe
2996	think hip roll sun shade helped nicely padded
2996	seat big brand name seat cushy padding
2996	also nice dark pattern help hide dirt stains
2996	personally hates headrest baby likes heads stay secure fine
2996	things dont like handle seat isnt ergonomically made sun shade feel flimsy like gust wind would blow right
2996	also locks deserve practicing get right
2996	overall happy cant believe baby slept car
2997	neat idea
2997	replacement bags cost much dont justify convenience
2997	honestly husband use plastic bags daily newspaper comes
2997	slim hold 710 diapers
2997	end day toss garage
2997	end story
2997	really need kind doodad another type use plastic bag
2997	thats much better deal
2998	may wondering
2998	medela pumps little nubs attach tubing thats pumping action works
2998	air sucked tubes shield go
2998	symphony `` hospital grade '' breast pump whats also safe sharing workplaces
2998	instead air sucked directly machine two pistons top pistons go responsible suction
2998	convert piston motion sucking need special attachment
2998	thats whats specific kit vs medela kits might include tubing shields bottles
2998	dont attachments connect symphony end story
2998	good kit
2998	need one like since symphony specific parts get dirty dont need washed really
2998	want shields bottles buy one many medela kits dont include extra symphony parts
2998	said kit includes everything need pump symphony
2998	dont need anything else
2998	aside include nipples bottles
2998	needs saying buying kit grab go somewhere want give bottles feeding need nipples bottles need bottles
2998	aside includes everything need dont need anything
2998	buying pump work would highly recommend medela quick clean wipes lets clean pumping parts without sink quick wipe toss back bag good go

4549	see info pad rail rider
4549	nursery space quite small thrilled one less piece furniture especially since piece furniture seemed us limited utility spacehog

4549	included pad also plastic also cleaned either way
4549	need special covers pad either since standard pillowcase fits well
4549	used couple old pillowcases swapping needed wash
4549	hear countless warnings parents preventing falls changing tables
4549	yet parents know least one person whose baby taken tumble changing table
4549	never experience rail rider gave us peace mind two reasons
4549	first wide sturdy easy snap/unsnap strap attaches rail rider keeping baby securely place
4549	second importantly positioning rail rider even unlikely case fall surface baby falls inches crib
4549	note still extremely careful since even shallow fall onto mattress cause serious injury child falls wrong way
4549	still felt better fact fall floor much much less likely traditional changing table
4549	rail rider sit perfect height changing babys diapers advantage regular changing table baby facing
4549	found much easier interactive `` sideways '' change necessary changing table
4549	rail rider wellbuilt seems pretty indestructible
4549	strong enough hold toddler think weight limit something like 50 pounds limited childs height
4549	however able use daughter pottytrained even though always 95th percentile height
4549	done absolutely worse wear looked like new
4549	problem positioning rail rider one end crib note sits level one side crib dropped position
4549	daughter newborn slept one end crib rail rider end
4549	got older longer able simply drop mattress lower level could sleep feet/legs extending surface raise side crib slept played crib way
4549	needed changing simply dropped side
4549	found much easier solution removing rail rider hanging side crib since bit cumbersome pad would fall
4549	world many useless baby products pushed new parents one seems unfamiliar people yet think real musthave

4837	button turn
4837	button three color choices green blue yellow
4837	wholeheartedly agree one reviewers yellow lighting dim hard see stars even dark room compared color choices
4837	mind im writing geek parents point view
4837	doubt kids would care
4837	also disappointed actual projection stars size pentagram starshaped color
4837	even `` major '' stars represented still makes difficult locate constellations since stars brightness color major guide locating night sky
4837	upshot even someone quite familiar night sky trouble locating easy constellations cant imagine average parent helping child see
4837	itd also nice moons phase adjustable although probably easier ways teach kids moon
4837	end im thinking 30 really expensive night light quality far low decent tool

5768	didnt like breast pump much accessories great
5768	provides enough storage leaky caps
5769	like whole system
5769	complaint another reviewer doesnt warn bag run
5769	ive used six months still like
5769	refills last forever
5770	tub great
5770	sling useful couple weeks babys cord fell allowed us give nice sponge bath keeping cord dry still bottom submerged bit
5770	cord fell sling longer necessary sit tub fine without additional support although still likes hold hand
5770	using bathroom counter fact would fit double sink would handy wanted use kitchen suppose
5771	bought keep rottweilers front seat jeep gc
5771	jeep fold seats wanted use behind rear seat behind front seat rear seats folded
5771	===the good points=== heard rattles ups guy delivered box waiting disaster
5771	however assembling unit trying almost rattles
5771	vertical poles use rubber grommets minimize rattle side wings clamped securely least far
5771	behind back seat product almost works fine subject fixes
5771	slips problem install uninstall minutes
5771	usually secure enough mounted behind back seat deter dogs
5771	doubt could push really tried opportunists dedicated escape artists
5771	=== notsogood points=== hoping use gate fold rear seats
5771	things bit problematic
5771	first base unit sits folded seat back
5771	seat back hard surface sitting top seat seatback upholstery tends compress
5771	result keep tightening gate doesnt fall
5771	takes 30 min tightening seat upholstery fully compresses
5771	length 1x4 across whole seat back spreads force makes problem little manageable
5771	problem installation gap bottom gate console front seats
5771	large enough tempt dog get underneath falls pretty easily albeit 90 pounds canine muscle
5771	contacted manufacturer suggested adding thisgmi petshield bucket seat tubular travel barrier
5771	unfortunately way seats center hump jeep really wont work
5771	plan adding another piece grating bottom existing grate enough discourage nosy dogs
5771	=== things fixed=== tension floor ceiling governed much tighten two thumbscrews threaded rods
5771	problem loosen car vibrates traveling
5771	first solution add another nut thumbscrew keep snug
5771	sort worked although would still work way loose
5771	better solution put small clamp thumbscrew wedged next backseat
5771	clamp used one cheapo plastic ones often checkout counter home depot
5771	prevented thumbscrew turning
5771	gate would also shake loose matter tight made screws
5771	solution bungee gate back seat headrests
5771	didnt tight enough keep gate vibrating towards front back vehicle working way loose
5771	sometimes hard really tighten gate place threaded rod rotate inside sleeves/feet
5771	instead tightening thumbscrew end rotating whole threaded rod doesnt tighten anything
5771	keeping pair channellock pliers handy fixes problem
5771	=== summary ===i really two applications mind product mounting behind front seat mounting behind back seat
5771	id call star performer behind front seatit doesnt seem stay installed without least partially supported back seat
5771	mounting behind back seatmaybe 1/2 star deal

5809	installed pads wrought iron coffee table far withstood tugging fidgeting 16 month old twin girls
5809	said follow installation instructions think pads would trash
5809	manufacturer recommends running solid strip tape along one side pads leaves side easy target little fingers gives leverage pull pads
5809	manufacturer included enough tape dont hope youre reading kidkusion would recommend running solid strip tape along sides pads since tape limited cut smaller strips inches stagger sides pad
5809	little time consuming made pads much secure
5809	would also recommend putting tape close outer edge possible little fingers cant get edges start prying
5809	working tape backing wasnt problem fingernails come handy
5809	manufacturer also recommends measuring cutting strips sticking seems like would leave much room error since strips stretch compress
5809	installed corner pieces first cut strips almost completely secured table pieces would match well
5809	cut one steady snip scissors multiple snips make edges jagged bit unsightly learned hard way
5809	even staggering tape run early track extra even im pleased outcome hardly notice pads blend well

5932	bought pump daughter three months old
5932	upon using work realized milk supply seriously dwindling couldnt figure
5932	pumped three four times per day work could get three four ounces milk per pumping session good day
5932	talk stressing outi talked lactation consultant explained pump isnt good frequent pumpers pumps one side time
5932	yes double electric suction alternates one side
5932	means ten minute pumping session breast gets five minutes worth pumping time
5932	obviously results much less suction time would spend nursing thus reduction milk supply
5932	since already low supply pump almost ended nursingso steer clear pump purchase advanced pump style plan kind long term pumping like work extended periods time increase supply
5932	reason advanced pump style costs works 100 better sturdy quieter reliable keep supply
5932	double electric pump awkward best would spill milk bottles get milk tubing time

5964	husband snapped back together seemed fine
5964	pushing baby mall double wheels popped
5964	frustrating difficult fix baby arms
5964	took back store exchanged new one
5964	gave universal snap go time store worker offered put together
5964	seemed like everything great problem solved
5964	well second time took trunk use one bigger rear wheels popped
5964	dont understand deal
5964	take care dont go offroading anything
5964	normal activities regular mom would
5964	looked wheel came pushed black circular cover take good look silver snap thing
5964	seems like little teeth snap onto groove metal rod thing little bent isnt snug needs

5964	anyway would love love stroller wheels would stay
5965	works dex bottle warmer grab go comes parts insulating bag warmer
5965	warmer warms way chemical reaction therefore need electricity
5965	use warmer simply curl warmer circle shape slide insulating bag slip bottle center
5965	double click starter disc small metal disc warmer wait warmer warm bottle
5965	used dex grab go need remove warmer insulating bag boil water 1015 minutes used
5965	ultimately bought dex grab gos could warm least meals needing find stove
5965	dex grab gos years old purchased aug 2005 jan 2006 used frequently eldest second child 4yrs using several times week
5965	unfortunately pulled storage mths ago use third child discovered longer worked correctly
5965	ive tried times matter long boil carefully handle activate begin crystallize even still cooling counter rendering useless
5965	years frequent use 12mths storage
5965	recall took around 515 minutes warm bottle depending whether starting room temperature chilled bottle depending much liquid bottle
5965	example room temperature 4oz bottle breastmilk would take minutes less heat 9oz bottle chilled formula would take 15
5965	yes working memory used quite often despite reviewers statements takes longer confidently say would put something took longer 15 minutes always feedondemand mother meant baby often crying warming process
5965	whether heats liquid `` sufficiently '' subject opinion mothers babies
5965	tell possible grossly overheat smaller portions chilled 9oz chilled bottle brought room temperature
5965	pros use bottle warmer need source electricity battery car lighter wall outlet
5965	means whether youre middle zoo mall swap meet dont hike back car plug warmer wait 1530 minutes like many travel bottle warmers require
5965	huge relief youre right smack middle christmas shopping cart full unpaid items baby suddenly decides hes hungry 45 minutes earlier usual
5965	also means take thing camping hiking okay kids probably nature walk point completely liberty please without worry near car campfire
5965	warmer insert gets hot
5965	mean hot
5965	exactly want faster warming time
5965	careful handling youve clicked starter disc
5965	make sure keep insulating bag cooled enough handle safely
5965	wraps bottle 360 degrees heat
5965	exactly want faster even warming time
5965	bottle warmers
5965	additional water required
5965	many travel warmers still require extra water source order warm bottle
5965	dump water somewhere youve used
5965	dex grab go eliminates added hassles
5965	fits bottles bent straight fat skinny
5965	fact havent found bottle yet doesnt fit
5965	admittedly heats skinnier bottles quickly fat ones kiddos ultimately preferred seems universal bottle warmers simply matter scientific fact fatter things take longer warm
5965	also taller bottles stick top warmer bit may need little shaking even warmth
5965	design doesnt click like electric warmers continues warm time reached maximum heat
5965	makes good keeping bottle warm warmed
5965	know babies like change minds occasionally might go get car seat feeding realize theyve decided first bm days wow youve got cleaning even think feeding
5965	case keeping bottle warm little longer originally expected helpful
5965	unlike pluginthe first years quick serve bottle warmeri home recommended btw warmer doesnt decide hot bottle gets
5965	many electric warmers shut automatically making impossible warm bottle beyond preset limits
5965	whereas warmer allows leave bottle hot warmer long little please
5965	allows adjust temperature suit babys tastes
5965	cons use needs boiled
5965	solved dilemma buying found needed
5965	taller bottles stick top warmer bit may need little shaking even warmth
5965	large portions
5965	9oz dont get warm smaller portions
5965	dont last forever
5965	mentioned dex grab gos appear stopped working sometime 12mths storage years frequent use
5965	still 10 piece years use works
5965	50/yr per warmer
5965	bad opinion
5965	let tell least handful times thought `` one time alone worth 10
5965	cant imagine
5965	`` tips help speed warming process bit especially large portions give little shake/swirl bottle every couple minutes
5965	think like stirring food cooked microwave
5965	removing warmer boiling handle care accidentally set starter disc
5965	sensitive point
5965	though infrequent problem
5965	maybe happened every 20 boilings
5965	boiling lay warmer heat safe flat surface allow liquid distribute evenly warmer cools
5965	helps ensure even heating makes inserting bottle easier
5965	like lay mine clean cookie sheet although solid trivet large hot pad tile counter top would work well
5965	regarding reviews young children diaper bag always stuffed gills yet frequently carried unused warmer years use accidentally set bag
5965	conclusion recommend im going tomorrow buy new one
5966	bottles leak cause much gas systems
5966	trying avoid gas try playtex originals dr
5966	want trendy priced bottle
5967	baby still hasnt arrived set walked around house bit reciever
5967	house big still places signal isnt good
5967	however bit tweaking get working adequately anywhere house
5967	paid considering much alternatives cost think works fine
5967	check however many wireless devices frequency bought
5967	seems main concern monitor might buy
5967	want economic option wireless devices arent frequency house isnt big device seems adequate

7974	arms powdercoated wash easily
7974	scratches table damage chairs
7974	chair folds flat carrying seems bulky arms tend flop easily portable
7974	would portable special bag even strap around
7974	weight limit chair says 37 lbs
7974	maybe metal strength chair good enough children reached 28 lbs mechanism tightens chairs table would longer release
7974	lap belt secure dont leave child unattended
7974	like chair would probably buy
7974	reason give stars instead weight limit
7974	disappointed release mechanism broke chairs children reached 28lbs chair wasnt cheap supposed go 37lbs cant pass

7979	whole idea able talk baby light show great thought
7979	however trying sleep monitor impossible much static amp annoying noises interference channelsthat cant sleep also hear baby unless screaming top lungs

8016	soft plastic hard enough hurt bumps buttons big responsive enough trouble pressing
8016	bright enough stars really cascade along every wall barring obstructions
8016	also used see check bright enough see without waking
8016	sits right crib one occasion attempted take morning keep playing
8016	battery life also amazing likely due auto shutoff
8016	change batteries roughly three months
8016	highly recommend anyone kids age
8016	nightlight doubles plush toy used teach basics stars inclined
8016	cant see age restrictions
8016	thing would make better shell also plush played soft music
8017	think much ordered

8019	mine didnt work pump
8019	wasnt operator error worked didnt work well didnt work equally well breasts one larger
8019	go electric even still would better variable shield
8020	son loves jumperoo love bit
8020	good investment son hates swing energetic alert
8020	almost four months old using since seven weeks
8020	took minutes first time realized could jump went wild
8020	also like product allows baby turn around seat dont position certain way
8020	regret purchase

8021	daughter 23 months started potty training process
8021	seat comfortable fun asks go sit
8021	ergonomic design ideal little bums way sits three toilets differnt sizes shapes geniusi cant recommend product enough
8022	bought sippy cup replace sons plastic ones avoid increasing concerns leeching chemicals

8022	doublewalled foogo makes much nicer product klean kanteen noninsulated one also
8022	keeps kids hands getting cold ice drinks importantly keep drink cool hours refrigerator
8022	handy roadtrips forgetting play room
8022	highly recommend children instead plastic sippy cups

8023	downside grinding food disk unmashed food left behind
8023	way get grinder always waste part trying make

8026	cant wait use playard see baby sitting playing toys
8027	big fan seventh generation cleaning products
8027	really wanted like baby wipes
8027	thought really unpleasant smell could overlook light wipes unscented natural cleansers
8027	overlook wipes really small flimsy
8027	diaper cleaning would end really dirty hands
8027	diapering one boy another years usually change child without getting hands covered potty wipes
8027	really disappointing
8028	bag thin material much outside covers bumgenius keep inside diaper pail first used like would garbage bag like shown pic folded pail could drop dirty diapers diaper pail lid
8028	poor little girls room smelled like pee bad next morning started pulling draw string stuffing bag pail try keep smell working either
